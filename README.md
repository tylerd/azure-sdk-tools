# Quick Start

In general, following are the steps to start using Windows Azure PowerShell

1. Get the publish settings information of your subscription
2. Import the information into Windows Azure PowerShell
3. Use the cmdlets

The first step can be different for different environment you are targeting. Following are detail instructions for each supported environment.

## Windows Azure

```powershell
# Download a file which contains the publish settings information of your subscription.
# This will open a browser window and ask you to log in to get the file.
Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile

# Import the file you just downloaded.
# Notice that the file contains credential of your subscription so you don't want to make it public
# (like check in to source control, etc.).
Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile "<file location>"

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-AzureWebsite -Name mywebsite -Location "West US"
```
## Windows Azure China

```powershell
# Check the environment supported by your Windows Azure PowerShell installation.
Get-AzureEnvironment

# Download a file which contains the publish settings information of your subscription.
# Use the -Environment parameter to target Windows Azure China.
# This will open a browser window and ask you to log in to get the file.
Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile -Environment "AzureChinaCloud"

# Import the file you just downloaded.
# Notice that the file contains credential of your subscription so you don't want to make it public
# (like check in to source control, etc.).
Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile "<file location>"

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-AzureWebsite -Name mywebsite -Location "China East"
```

## Windows Azure Pack

```powershell
# Add your Windows Azure Pack environment to your Windows Azure PowerShell installation.
# You will need to know the following information of your Windows Azure Pack environment.
# 1. URL to download the publish settings file    Mandatory
# 2. Management service endpoint                  Optional
# 3. Management Portal URL                        Optional
# 4. Storage service endpoint                     Optional
Add-WAPackEnvironment -Name "MyWAPackEnv" `
    -PublishSettingsFileUrl "URL to download the publish settings file>" `
    -ServiceEndpoint "<Management service endpoint>" `
    -ManagementPortalUrl "<Storage service endpoint>" `
    -StorageEndpoint "<Management Portal URL>"

# Download a file which contains the publish settings information of your subscription.
# Use the -Environment parameter to target your Windows Azure Pack environment.
# This will open a browser window and ask you to log in to get the file.
Get-WAPackPublishSettingsFile -Environment "MyWAPackEnv"

# Import the file you just downloaded.
# Notice that the file contains credential of your subscription so you don't want to make it public
# (like check in to source control, etc.).
Import-WAPackPublishSettingsFile "<file location>"

# Use the cmdlets to manage your services/applications
New-WAPackWebsite -Name mywebsite
```

# Find Your Way

All the cmdlets can be put into 3 categories:

1. Cmdlets support both Windows Azure and Windows Azure Pack
2. Cmdlets only support both Windows Azure
3. Cmdlets only support Windows Azure Pack

* For category 1, we are using an "Azure" prefix in the cmdlet name and adding an alias with "WAPack" prefix.
* For category 2, we are using an "Azure" prefix in the cmdlet name.
* For category 2, we are using an "WAPack" prefix in the cmdlet name.

So you can use the following cmdlet to find out all the cmdlets for your environment

```powershell
# Return all the cmdlets for Windows Azure
Get-Command *Azure*

# Return all the cmdlets for Windows Azure Pack
Get-Command *WAPack*
```

If you want to migrate some scripts from Windows Azure to Windows Azure Pack or vice versa, as long as the cmdlets you are using are in category 1, you should be able to migrate smoothly.
